      comprehensive view of the stockâ€™s price movements and market activity for
      Nintendo to help internal and external stakeholders including buyers and
      sellers to analyze market sentiment.The dataset contains detailed
      historical stock price data for Nintendo, covering the period from
      1996-11-18 to 2024-06-14.The data is collected from a public web site

        href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stealthtechnologies/nintendo-stock-data/data"
        >kaggle.com</a

      <br />
      and includes daily records of the stock's opening price, highest price,
      lowest price, closing price, and trading volume.
